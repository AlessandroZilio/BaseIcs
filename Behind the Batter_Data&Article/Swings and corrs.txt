Swing profiles and tendencies: a study on Y2Y correlation and impact on WAR variability
-Introduction: parameters with definitions
               WAR as FA indicator
               underlying stats instead of raw results
-Y2Y correlation: 19-20 correlations
                  18-20 correlations (2ygap)
                  17-20 correlations (3ygap)
Results: keep high corr elements as FA indicators
-WAR variability: logreg of WAR on "stable" indicators
Results: how much variance of WAR is explained by chosen underliners?
         how does it help to evaluate FA (predictive) or in trades (explanatory)?
         what is more stable: tendencies (hard/barrel) or profiles (gb/fb/ld)?
